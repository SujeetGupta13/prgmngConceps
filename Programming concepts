Programming languages are those who use compiler and Scripting languages are those which use Interpreter.
Compiler and Interpreter both converts HLL into machine language(binary language 0's and 1's).
 *Is there any difference between Programming Languages and Scripting Languages?
     Yes. In case of scripting language, Interpretor compiles HLL into machine language line by line
          whereas Compiler compiles HLL language into machine language in one chunk.
          So, a scripting language is also called programming language.
     Programming language(PL) : C, C#, C++, Java, Pascal, COBOL etc. 
     Scripting language(SL) : JS, Python, Ruby, Shell, Pearl, PHP etc. 
     PL creates a .exe file whereas SL doesn't. PL is self executable means doesn't require amy host whereas SL requires host like Browsers.
     Pl requires program to be compiled before execution whereas SL will be interpreted line by line while execution in host(Browser does interpretation).
     We can design a interpreter for C lang and C lang can be used as a scripting lang. Same way Compiler can be designed for JS and can used as a programming language.
     V8 JS engine of Chrome compiles the JS code into machine language.  
     So The bottom line is the environment decides the feature and generates the difference bw SL and PL.
     PL areused to build the application whereas SL are used to control the app. 

TypeScript(TS .ts or .tsx) is super set of JS(.js).(JS plus other features). JS does not have MultiThreading or MultiProcessing capabalities.
     TS is trans compiled or transpiled into JS code before execution as browser only understand JS.
     TS is used in Client side whereas JS both side.
     TS have Syntax(rules for writing programs) and that syntax is composed of Modules, Functions, Varibles, Statement and expression etc.
     whereas in JS everything is written inside script tag.
